```

## Decision Tree

```
IF all tests pass
  AND coverage > 80%
  AND no critical issues
  AND documentation exists
THEN
  Score >= 70
  Status = APPROVED
ELSE IF critical issues exist
THEN
  Score < 70
  Status = NEEDS_WORK
  List required fixes
ELSE
  Score 70-85
  Status = APPROVED_WITH_NOTES
  List improvements
```

## Final Actions

After review:
1. **Update state.json** with score
2. **Write review report** to `.claude/reviews/task-*-final-review.md`
3. **Mark task complete** if approved
4. **List required fixes** if not approved

## Quality Standards
